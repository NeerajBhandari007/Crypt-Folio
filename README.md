# Crypto Folio

Crypto Folio is a web application made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides real-time data and updates on the cryptocurrency market, allowing users to track prices, volume, market capitalization, community growth, open-source code development, major events, and on-chain metrics.

The website features smooth animations and interactive elements to enhance user experience. It is currently optimized for desktop screens and mobile screens with a width of 400 pixels. However, it may not function properly on other mobile screen sizes or larger screens.
